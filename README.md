# StudyBuddy
2023 Summer Orbital project



Proposed Level of Achievement:
Project Gemini



Motivation:
University can be very isolating and students often find themselves struggling with the sheer difficulty and amount of content taught. The one thing that helps though - studying with friends! 

However, many come into university not knowing many people, not to mention people taking the same modules. Walking up to someone in a class filled with strangers can be intimidating to say the least so what better than an app that can help students find a study buddy! 

Introducing StudyBuddy! : an app that matches you up with people taking the same modules, helping you find the study buddy of your dreams.



Aim:
We hope to make it easier for NUS students to find appropriate people that will not only study with them, but also people who will motivate them to study through a convenient and efficient app.



User Stories:
1. As a student, I want to be able to customise my profile by entering in my information 

2. As a student, I want to be able to view other users’ profiles so I can view information such as their major, year of study as well as their personal introduction.

3. As a student who has problems finding suitable people to study with, I want to be able to use this app to make this process easier and find buddies who take the same modules and suit my liking. 

4. As a student, I want to be able to send messages to others such that if they are interested, they can choose to respond and open a chat with me. Through this chat function, we can get to know each other better and make study plans.



Scope of Project & Development plans :
The app provides a platform for students looking for study buddies to find people who take the same courses and chat to build rapport and set study sessions.

1st week of May: Ideation and settling on the relevant features
2nd week of May: Poster and video submissions for Lift-off
3rd week of May: Pick up necessary technology. Created mockups
4th - 5th week of May: Start working on login and registration page, together with the needed tabs in the app. Milestone 1 submission

1st week of June: Do further research on React Native and how to build features. Begin working on the implementation of user profiles. 
2nd week of June: Implement a concrete user profile interface as well as set up the database. Make other user’s profiles visible. 
3rd week of June: Begin implementation of the chat feature. 
4th week of June: Finish implementation of the chat feature. Begin implementation of the matching algorithms to match users with their prospective study buddies. 

1st week of July: Continue and finish implementation of the matching algorithm. 
2nd week of July: Testing and debugging.
3rd week of July: Continue testing and refining the app, adding optimisations (eg. a search bar for the chat).
4th week of July: Milestone 3 submission.

How are we different from similar platforms?
● Course-specific matching
Unlike general study buddy apps, our app focuses on matching students who are studying the same courses within NUS. This targeted approach allows students to connect with peers who are currently studying the exact subjects they need assistance with, ensuring a more relevant and effective study partnership.

● Built-in chat function
Our app includes a chat function that enables students to communicate directly within the platform. This eliminates the need for students to switch between multiple apps or platforms to coordinate their study sessions. By providing an integrated chat feature, we streamline the process of arranging study sessions, making it more convenient and efficient for users.
